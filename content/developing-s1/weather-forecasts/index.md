Weather is extremely important for aviation, and controllers need to know how to read weather reports and understand how the weather will impact operations.

The real world ZSE ARTCC produces a regular [pre-duty weather briefing](https://www.weather.gov/zse/PDWBsite) which is a helpful summary of current weather affecting ATC.

For details on these topics and much more, see the [vZAB seminar on aviation weather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvJT2PQBDtc).

## Understanding weather measurements

When dealing with aviation weather data, you'll come across various measurements like altitudes and wind directions. It's important to know what each value is relative to, as it can change depending on the source.

METAR/TAF clouds are in **AGL** (above ground level).

METAR/TAF winds are in **true** heading; however, flying is done with **magnetic** heading. In ZSE, **subtract 20째** from the true wind heading to get the magnetic wind heading. The number of degrees to add or subtract will vary by ARTCC.

> [!TIP]
> When giving wind information to pilots, it will always be in **magnetic** heading. On VATSIM, a text communication with a pilot such as a text ATIS or message to a text-only pilot is considered voice, and the wind will be in **magnetic** heading.
>
> A common mantra to remember this is: "If you read it, it's true. If you hear it, it's magnetic."

## Flight rule minimums

For aircraft to fly at an airport under Visual Flight Rules (VFR), the weather must meet [specific minimums](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFR4d5279ba676bedc/section-91.155#p-91.155%28c%29): 3 miles visibility and 1000 foot ceilings. The [ceiling](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-1/section-1.1#p-1.1%28Ceiling%29) is defined as the lowest **broken (BKN)** or **overcast (OVC)** layer.

If the visibility is [at least 1 mile](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91#91.157), airplanes may request [**Special VFR (SVFR)**](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc_html/chap7_section_5.html) to enter or depart the airport area.

## METAR

METeorological Aerodrome Reports (METARs) typically come from airports. Reports are generated once an hour, but if conditions change significantly at a staffed location, a report known as a special (SPECI) may be issued.
A typical METAR contains data for the temperature, dew point, wind direction, and speed, precipitation, cloud cover and heights, visibility, and barometric pressure. A METAR may also contain information on precipitation amounts, lightning, and other information that would be of interest to pilots or meteorologists such as a pilot report or PIREP, color states, and runway visual range (RVR).

METARs and TAFs have many [abbreviations and acronyms](https://www.weather.gov/media/wrh/mesowest/metar_decode_key.pdf). Another helpful site is [metar-taf.com](https://metar-taf.com) which provides a plain text description and graphical depiction of the conditions in the METAR and TAF.

Here is an example METAR from Hillsboro, Oregon (KHIO):

```plaintext
METAR KHIO 192253Z 12012KT 10SM SCT019 BKN055 09/04 A2966 RMK AO2 SLP044 T00890044
```

Each item of the METAR is decoded as follows:

| Item      | Description                                                             |

| KHIO      | The station identifier (Hillsboro Airport)                              |
| 192253Z   | The date and time of the report (19th day of the month at 22:53 UTC)    |
| 12012KT   | Wind from 120 degrees at 12 knots (in true heading)                     |
| 10SM      | Visibility of 10 statute miles                                          |

> [!NOTE]
> Items after the `RMK` field are not always present. Decoding items after the `RMK` field is not required for the S1 ratings examination.

## TAF

Terminal Area Forecasts (TAFs) are issued at least four times a day, every six hours, for major civil airfields: 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 UTC, and generally apply to a 24- or 30-hour period, and an area within approximately five statute miles from the center of an airport runway complex. Not all airports with a METAR will have a TAF.

Here is an example TAF taken from KHIO:

## METAR and TAF in practice

As an S1, the most common use for weather forecasts is to verify the altimeter before issuing a clearance, to ensure the aircraft's filed flight level is valid.

### Example 1

The METAR at KPDX is as follows. What is the wind and altimeter?

```plaintext
METAR KPDX 131753Z 08004KT 10SM FEW250 12/03 A3035 RMK AO2 SLP277 T01170033
```

The wind is 60째 at 4 knots, 80째 minus 20째 correction for magnetic deviation. The altimeter is 30.35.
