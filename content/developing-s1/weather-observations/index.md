SIGMETs and AIRMETs are types of weather advisories that are issued to pilots about weather phenomena which may affect the safety of aircraft operations. You will see these in aviation weather briefings. The main importance for ATC is knowing what kinds of significant weather might be expected that will affect airport operations or aircraft routing. More detail is available in [AIM 7-1-6](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap7_section_1.html#$paragraph7-1-6).

## SIGMET

A Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET) is a concise description of the occurrence or expected occurrence of specified en route weather phenomena which is expected to affect the safety of aircraft operations. The key word here is that this weather could be significant to any aircraft.

There are three main types of SIGMET:

- Volcanic Ash
- Tropical Cyclone
- Other
  - Thunderstorm types
  - Turbulence types
  - Mountain waves
  - Icing/Sleet/Hail
  - Dust or sand storms
  - Radioactive Cloud

The US has an additional type of SIGMET: the Convective SIGMET. This is issued for one of three types of thunderstorms:

- Line
- Area
- Embedded

## AIRMET

Airmen's Meteorological Information

An Airmen's Meteorological Information (AIRMET) is a concise description of the occurrence or expected occurrence of specified en route weather phenomena that may affect the safety of aircraft operations, but at intensities lower than those which require the issuance of a SIGMET. They are intended to inform all pilots, but will be of more importance to VFR flights or aircraft operations particularly sensitive to hazardous weather.

There are three types of AIRMET identified by phonetic letters:

- **Sierra** - Ceiling and visibility
  - **IFR** (Ceilings less than 1000 feet and/or visibility less than 3 miles affecting over 50% of the area at one time)
  - Extensive mountain obscuration
- **Tango** - Turbulence
  - Moderate **turbulence**
  - Sustained **surface winds** of 30 knots or greater
  - Non-convective **low-level wind shear**
- **Zulu** - Icing
  - Moderate **icing** along with freezing levels
