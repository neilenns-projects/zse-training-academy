## Clearance delivery

Clearance delivery issues IFR clearances to aircraft, provides restrictions to VFR aircraft as needed, and does the bulk of strip-marking.

Not all airports have a clearance delivery controller, but the service will be provided by the next highest controller.

## Ground controller

Ground Control is responsible for providing separation to aircraft on the ground, sequencing them for departure, and coordinating with local.

Not all airports have a ground controller, but the service will be provided by the next highest controller.
