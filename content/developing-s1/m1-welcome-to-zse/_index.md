- [Airspace classes](airspace-classes)
- [Special Use Airspace](special-use-airspace)
- [Weather forecasts](weather-forecasts) and [observations](weather-observations)
- [Aircraft navigation capabilities](equipment-suffixes) and [airways](https://sites.google.com/zseartcc.org/training/modulesm1-airways?authuser=0)

Required reading:

- [vZSE Facility Operation and Administration 7210.3](https://zseartcc.org/documents/view/269)
- [vZSE ATC Training 3120.4](https://zseartcc.org/documents/view/270)

## VATSIM resources

The [ZSE website](https://zseartcc.org/) contains important [documents](https://zseartcc.org/documents/), including all policy statements, standard operating procedures (SOPs), resources, and additional training materials.

The [VATUSA website](https://www.vatusa.net/) provides guidance on ARTCC membership, division policies, the VATUSA academy, and news and events.

The [VATSIM global controller administration policy](https://vatsim.net/docs/policy/global-controller-administration-policy) is an important resource for guidelines around ATC positions, the training process, and expected controller competencies.

## Official references

[FAA Order JO 7110.65](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc_html/) is the official reference for all policies and procedures for air traffic controllers in the United States. The FAA also publishes a list of [aircraft types, categories, and classes](https://www.faa.gov/documentlibrary/media/order/order_7360.1.pdf) and a [chart users' guide](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/aero_guide/) that explains everything about FAA charts.

The [Aeronautical Information Manual](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/) is the pilot equivalent of 7110.65.

## Vatsim tools

[VATSIM Radar](https://www.vatsim-radar.com/) is a widely-used website for seeing traffic on the network.

[SkyVector](https://skyvector.com/) is a useful site for visualizing a filed route, charting a different route, and verifying direction of flight.

[CRC](https://vnas.vatsim.net/crc), [vStrips](https://vnas.vatsim.net/vstrips), and [vTDLS](https://vnas.vatsim.net/vtdls) are the core three applications used when controlling in the United States. Documentation on all three is available on their respective websites.

## Other resources

FlightAware offers an [IFR route analyzer](https://www.flightaware.com/statistics/ifr-route/) that shows IFR routes between airport pairs flown by actual flights in the real world.

Wikipedia maintains a [list of airplanes and their maximum takeoff weight](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/List_of_airliners_by_maximum_takeoff_weight).
