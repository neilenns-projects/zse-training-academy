Weather is extremely important for aviation, and controllers need to know how to read weather reports and understand how the weather will impact operations.

The real world ZSE ARTCC produces a regular [pre-duty weather briefing](https://www.weather.gov/zse/PDWBsite) which is a helpful summary of current weather affecting ATC.

For details on these topics and much more, see the [vZAB seminar on aviation weather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvJT2PQBDtc).
