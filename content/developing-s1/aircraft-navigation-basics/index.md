## Equipment suffixes

Equipment suffixes are used to indicate the navigation capabilities of an aircraft. The suffix is added to the aircraft's call sign in the flight plan and is used by air traffic control to determine the appropriate separation and routing for the aircraft.

The suffixes are as follows:
